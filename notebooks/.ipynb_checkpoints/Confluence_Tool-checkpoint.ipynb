You can use Confluence to create a rich knowledge base or to collaborate with others using words, videos, images, graphics, charts, and graphs. This page walks you through some Confluence basics like spaces, pages, and elements that allow you to create and manage impactful content for your teams. Confluence 101 https://www.loom.com/share/5149671332234032989863f520d133ed 🗃️ Spaces Spaces are where teams organize ideas, projects, and documentation. Spaces can be customized and integrated with both Atlassian tools and others. Spaces can be organized with folders , and you can drag and drop to reorder or nest content so you can more effectively share your work with others. More about spaces 16 incomplete Select + Create at the top and choose Space to create a new space. 📄 Content types Live docs let you collaborate in realtime with your team for better ideas, faster decisions, and unified edits – all without needing to publish. Pages start as drafts that can be published into source-of-truth knowledge for your team — ideal for sharing policies, guides, and playbooks. Whiteboards are your team’s place to brainstorm, build connections, and make ideas come to life. Databases enable teams to build a library of information, track deliverables, and aggregate tools, links, and information from within and outside Confluence into a customizable view. Smart links allow users to integrate and display content from other tools and platforms directly within Confluence, enhancing productivity by centralizing information in one accessible location.

More about page header images 2285 incomplete Hover over your page title and select Add header image to customize your page. 💬 Comments and mentions Comments are a great way to start a conversation about a page or blog post. They allow you to remark on content, add important information, ask questions, and generally drive collaboration and teamwork. @mention a teammate to bring them into the conversation, and they can reply to and/or like comments.

It bridges the gap between data science and IT operations, ensuring smooth model lifecycles from data prep and training to monitoring for issues like data drift and retraining for continuous improvement. Key Aspects of MLOps: Automation: Automates repetitive tasks like data processing, model training, testing, and deployment using CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipelines. Collaboration: Fosters teamwork between data scientists, ML engineers, and IT operations. Lifecycle Management: Covers the entire ML lifecycle: data prep, model training, versioning, deployment, monitoring, and retraining. Monitoring & Governance: Tracks model performance, detects data/concept drift, ensures compliance, and provides documentation. MLOps vs. DevOps : Focus: DevOps for applications, MLOps for ML models (with data & model versioning). Artifacts: Source code vs. models, datasets, pipelines. Metrics: Application performance vs. model accuracy, drift, bias. Why MLOps is Important: Reliability & Scalability: Ensures models work consistently in production. Faster Deployment: Gets models into production more quickly.

They replaced older recurrent methods ( RNNs / LSTMs ) by processing entire sequences at once, leading to faster training and better context understanding. Key Concepts Self-Attention : The core mechanism allowing the model to look at other words in the input to better understand a specific word, determining relevance and context. Encoder-Decoder : Often built with an encoder (to understand input) and a decoder (to generate output), though some models use only one part. Parallel Processing: Unlike RNNs, transformers process all input tokens simultaneously, making them much faster and scalable. Positional Encoding: Since they don't process sequentially, they add positional info to understand word order. How They Work (Simplified) Input: Text (or other sequence data) is broken down into tokens (words/sub-words) and converted to numerical representations. Positional Encoding: Added to show word order. Encoder: Processes input, using self-attention to understand context and relationships between words, creating rich representations. Decoder: Takes encoder output and generates the final sequence (e.g., translated sentence, story). Applications Natural Language Processing (NLP): Machine translation, text summarization, question answering, chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini). Computer Vision: Image recognition, object detection (Vision Transformers - ViTs). Other: Speech recognition, protein folding, recommendation systems. Why They Matter Transformers are foundational to modern AI, powering large language models (LLMs) and achieving state-of-the-art results across many domains due to their efficiency and ability to grasp complex context.\"), Document(metadata={'title': 'GenAI', 'id': '983041', 'source': 'https://saichittisubrahmanyam-1765380226544.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~7120204b94e2b9298a4e8ab6299917ba642c83/pages/983041/GenAI', 'when': '2025-12-10T15:38:09.599Z'}, page_content='Gen AI (Generative AI) is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new, original content like text, images, music, code, and video by learning patterns from vast amounts of data, essentially mimicking human creativity to produce novel outputs rather than just analyzing existing data. It uses deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and neural networks to understand and generate human-like responses, powering tools from simple autocomplete to advanced chatbots and creative design assistants. How it Works Learning Patterns: Trained on massive datasets, Gen AI models learn complex structures and relationships within the data (text, images, etc.). Generation: When given a prompt, it uses these learned patterns to generate new, similar content. Key Models: Techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (with a generator and discriminator) and Transformers (for language) are fundamental. Examples & Uses Text: Writing emails, stories, code, summaries (e.g., ChatGPT). Images: Creating art from descriptions (e.g., DALL-E). Audio/Video: Generating music, voiceovers, or even video clips. Productivity: Automating tasks, improving customer service (chatbots), code generation, marketing content. Key Benefits Increased Productivity: Speeds up content creation and research. Enhanced Creativity: Acts as a brainstorming partner. Personalization: Tailors content and experiences for users. Risks & Challenges Inaccuracy: Can produce false or misleading information (hallucinations). Bias: May reflect and amplify biases present in training data. IP Concerns: Questions about ownership and copyright of generated content. Security: Processing sensitive data raises privacy risks.')]\n"
